# Graph-Theory-Analysis
Analysis of Protein Pathways Database in R using Graph Theory and Statistical Methods 

This code includes an analysis of an original protein pathways data, of the graph theories betweenness centrality and degree distribution
and compares a simulated betweenness centrality and degree distribution with the origninal graph's betweenness centrality and degree distribution.

The simulated generative graphs used in this analysis are Barabasi-Albert from python's NetworkX package and the Power Law Clustering graph in python's NetworkX package.
