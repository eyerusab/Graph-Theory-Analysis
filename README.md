# Graph-Theory-Analysis
Analysis of Protein Pathways Database in R using Graph Theory and Statistical Methods 

This code includes an analysis of an original protein pathways data, of the graph theories betweenness centrality and degree distribution
and compares a simulated betweenness centrality and degree distribution with the origninal graph's betweenness centrality and degree distribution.

The simulated generative graphs used in this analysis are Barabasi-Albert from python's NetworkX package and the Power Law Clustering graph in python's NetworkX package.

The Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) was used to compare the original with the generated graphs, and Chi-squared test was used to test the statistical significance of the generated data with the original.
